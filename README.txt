This no longer works as is without a leapmotion headset controller. If you have one you can run her right up in Unity. Otherwise, watch this space for a video showing off the features when I can work out a workaround.

To move through the game as a stopgap while I didn't have the LEAPMotion to work with, press Return to hit Play, or Next, whenever they're up.
Once the hands are back in just run through the games to check that they're working okay but I was without the Leap for a while and may have screwed some things up
whilst working on the UI without it. The best way to press buttons is using a proximity detector, there are some in the scene for you to take a look at.

Buttons pressing could be an animation or a couple of lines of code in an IEnumerator Coroutine.
